Jenkins Test Project
--------------------

I'm currently reading [Jenkins: The Definitive Guide](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920010326.do), which is an awesome book.

However, the [test project](https://github.com/wakaleo/game-of-life) uses Maven, and I don't like Maven.

Make and Bash are near and dear to my heart, so here you go.
